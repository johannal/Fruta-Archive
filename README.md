# Fruta 2.0 

Fruta is a multiplatform app which highlights bleeding edge features for WWDC Keynote, State of the Union, and Session content. A stripped down version will eventually be made available as an update to the [currently shipping sample code release](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/fruta_building_a_feature-rich_app_with_swiftui).

## WWDC 2021

Fruta is under active development for WWDC 2021. This repo is the expected branching point for demos and sessions, but not the sample code release.

Contact Jake Sawyer on Slack or Email to coordinate working with the Fruta project for WWDC 2021.

## Radar

Radar component and keywords TBD for WWDC 2021.
