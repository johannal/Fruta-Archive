# Fruta 2.0 

Fruta is a multiplatform app which highlights bleeding edge features for WWDC Keynote, State of the Union, and Session content. A stripped down version will eventually be made available as an update to the [currently shipping sample code release](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/fruta_building_a_feature-rich_app_with_swiftui).

## WWDC 2021

Fruta is under active development for WWDC 2021. This repo is the expected branching point for demos and sessions, but not the sample code release.

Contact Jake Sawyer on Slack or Email to coordinate working with the Fruta project for WWDC 2021.

## Project Architecture

This year's base version of Fruta will include simple iOS and macOS app targets without any submodules, packages, playgrounds, or associated targets. All extended functionality that introduce extra signing or capabilities requirements are moved to new "Extended" targets which include things like Apple Pay, Sign in with Apple, App Clip, Widgets, and some other features.

We also will have several branching off points based on SDK or timeline requirements â€” please reach out to Jake Sawyer to coordinate your needs, especially if they include something related to the Extended targets above.
